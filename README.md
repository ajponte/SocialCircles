SocialCircles
=============

Model friend memberships to multiple circles
---------

Social Circles help users organize their personal social networks.  These are implemented as "circles" on Google+, and as "lists" on Facebook and Twitter. Each circle consists of a subset of a particular user's friends. Such circles may be disjoint, overlap, or be hierarchically nested.

The goal of this app is to automatically infer users' social circles. We are provided a set of users, each of whose circles must be inferred. To do this, participants have access to:

-A list of the user's friends
-Anonymized Facebook profiles of each of those friends
-A network of connections between those friends (their "ego network")
To give you an idea of how to use this data, the problem of detecting social circles has been discussed (in an academic setting) in http://i.stanford.edu/~julian/pdfs/nips2012.pdf
